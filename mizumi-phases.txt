Mizumi: A vector database in Rust

Each phase in this plan produces a working piece of the database.

Phase 1: The Foundation & CLI (Current Phase)
Learning the Rust syntax, ownership, and building the project structure.

    [Done] Project Setup: cargo init, Cargo.toml.
    [Done] Command Line Arguments: Parsing user input (std::env).
    [] Basic Modules: Creating src/ingest.rs to separate logic from main.rs.
    [] Error Handling: Replace println! with Result<T, E> and ? operator.
    [] Structs & Enums: Define a Bookmark struct (URL, title, content) and an Action enum (Add, Search, List).

Phase 2: Ingestion & Data Processing (The "Rivers")
Learning the aspect of HTTP + HTML parsing + asynchronous Rust.

    [] Dependencies: Add reqwest (HTTP) and scraper (HTML parsing) to Cargo.toml.
    [] Async/Await: Convert main to #[tokio::main] and write an async fetcher string.
    [] HTML Parsing: Extract readable text from raw HTML (handling messy tags).
    [] Traits: Implement a Cleanable trait to standardize how we clean text from different sources (PDF vs HTML).

Phase 3: The HNSW Index (The "Lake")
Exploring the HNSW algorithmic indexing + memory layout + the aspect of distance

    [] Vector Math: Create a Vector type (wrapper around Vec<f32>). Implement cosine_similarity and euclidean_distance.
    [] The Node Struct: Create a Node struct for the graph (holds vector + links to neighbors).
    [] Layered Graph: Implement the "Hierarchical" structure (layers of linked lists).
    [] Greedy Search: implement search_layer (finding the closest node in a single graph layer).
    [] Insertion Logic: The complex part—finding the right spot for a new node and updating neighbor links across layers.
    [] Concurrency (Bonus): Use RwLock or Mutex to make the index thread-safe for simultaneous reads/writes.

Phase 4: Embeddings (The "Transformation")
Generating the embeddings for the captured text data

    [] Model Integration: Use candle-core (Hugging Face Rust port) to load a small model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
    [] Tokenization: Turn text into tokens, then into embeddings.
    [] Batching: Process multiple bookmarks at once to speed up ingestion.

Phase 5: Storage & Persistence (The "Bedrock")
Storing the graph onto the disk so that we do not lose data on restart.

    [] Serialization: Use serde and bincode to convert our HNSW graph structure into bytes.
    [] File I/O: Write the bytes to a file (mizumi.db) and read them back on startup.
    [] Memory Mapping (Optional): Use memmap2 for loading large indexes without consuming all RAM.

Phase 6: The User Interface (The "Shore")
Making Mizumi usable for the last mile user

    [] Search CLI: mizumi search "optimizing rust code".
    [] TUI (Terminal UI): Use ratatui to show search results in a nice interactive list.
